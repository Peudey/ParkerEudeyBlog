Long first half of the semester, pair that with an increase
in demand for 3d design work and you have the perfect storm that made madenot even want to touch this 
blog at all or think about anything in my off time.

With spring break hitting and finally getting time to get reasonably ahead in my work
I have finally found the time to finish up some changes and reworks I had planned.
The first one and a relatively minor change graphically, but is important to me in making this blog 
functional as well as pleasing to look at.

# Persistance

I was struggling with this originally, this is just a simple
single page blog and I was aiming to keep it stateless and try to expand my skills. 
In order to make this happen, I modified our hook for the light and dark mode button just a bit.

```jsx
  useEffect(() => {
    const localTheme = window.localStorage.getItem('theme');
    if (localTheme){
      setTheme(localTheme);
    } else {
      setMode('light')
    }
    setComponentMounted(true);
  }, []);
```

This is a fairly straight forward change that just stores if the page is loaded or not and loads up the saved theme. 
Previously when you would visit the page or mavigate between posts you would see the page load for just a split second in the 
light theme and then immediately switch to dark if that is what was cached. This was an extreme eye sore and I was not happy with it.

Further changes, some refactoring and some slight visual changes, a slight glow that is displayed when you hover a post and some minor cleanups.
