I am excited to publish my first web dev project using React and Gatsby.

My name is Parker Eudey, I am a Software Engineering student and former Mechanical designer. I model and design props to 3d print and paint for a living.
I started writing entries on this blog as soon as I had the back end roughed out. I hope to post regularly
and share my programming journey with all of you!
