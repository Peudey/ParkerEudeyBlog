I have been doing some research and have some features I would like to add before I feel like this project is
truly launched. So this post is going to act as my immutable to do list.

### To-Do
* Light and Dark themes.
* Handle posting images.
* Tags for posts
* Search through posts by tag title or date
* Comments

I am going to be quite busy once the semester starts though so I will likely go AWOL.
